  <!-- Take a look at this link for help.
  The point of this challenge is to display a list of two books on your browser.
  In the body of the HTML page, create an empty div:
  <div class="listBooks"></div>
  In the js file, create an array called allBooks. This is an array of objects. Each object is a book that has 4 keys (ie. 4 properties) :
  title,
  author,
  image : a url,
  alreadyRead : which is a boolean (true or false).
  Initiate the array with 2 books of your choice (ie. Add manually 2 books objects in the array)
  Requirements : All the instructions below need to be coded in the js file:
  Using the DOM, render the books inside an HTML table (the HTML table must be added to the <div> created in part 1).
  For each book :
  You have to display the book’s title and the book’s author.
  Example: HarryPotter written by JKRolling.
  The width of the image has to be set to 100px.
  If the book is already read. Set the color of the book’s details to red. -->
  <div class="'listBooks"></div>
  <script>
    let allBooks =[{
      tile:'',
      author:'',
      image :URL,
      alreadyRead : false,
    }]
    for(i=0;
